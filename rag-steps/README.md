# 📚 RAG Implementation Steps

This directory contains the step-by-step implementation of our RAG system. Each step builds on the previous one, gradually constructing a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation application.

## 🗺️ Learning Path

### Day 1 - From Docs to Answers

#### 📌 Step 1: Project Setup
- Setting up the Node.js development environment
- Installing required npm dependencies
- Configuring API access for LLaMA 3
- Basic Express.js project structure

#### 📌 Step 2: Document Ingestion
- Loading documents from various sources (PDF, Markdown, web)
- Text extraction techniques
- Document metadata handling
- Building a document pipeline

#### 📌 Step 3: Chunking and Embedding
- Text chunking strategies
- Understanding token limits
- Generating embeddings with transformers.js
- Optimizing chunk size for retrieval

#### 📌 Step 4: Vector Storage
- Setting up PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Creating vector database schema
- Storing document chunks and embeddings
- Basic vector operations

#### 📌 Step 5: Retrieval Implementation
- Semantic search with vector similarity
- Top-k retrieval methods
- Filtering and metadata-based search
- Evaluating retrieval quality

#### 📌 Step 6: LLM Integration
- Connecting to LLaMA 3 API with Node.js
- Building effective prompts
- Context window management
- Handling API responses with async/await

### Day 2 - Polishing and Deployment

#### 📌 Step 7: RAG Pipeline Optimization
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Hybrid retrieval (vector + keyword)
- Re-ranking strategies
- Handling edge cases and fallbacks

#### 📌 Step 8: Deployment and Frontend
- Deploying the Express.js backend
- Containerization with Docker
- Building a React or Vue.js frontend
- End-to-end testing

## 🚀 How to Use This Directory
